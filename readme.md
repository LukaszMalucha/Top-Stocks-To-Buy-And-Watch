## Project Overview

What stocks are good to invest in for Value Investor? What are the most likely acquisition targets? As price is not always the best indicator when looking for undervalued companies, let's find out which stocks have the lowest financial ratios such as price-to-earnings, price-to-book, debt-to-equity, and price/earnings-to-growth to discover undervalued stocks. Based on Yahoo Finance data.
